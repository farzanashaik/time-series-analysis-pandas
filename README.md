# time-series-analysis-pandas

In this notebook we analysed how to wrangle, analyze, and visualize our time series data in pandas using techniques such as time-based indexing, resampling, and rolling windows. Applying these techniques to our OPSD data set, we've gained insights on seasonality, trends, and other interesting features of electricity consumption and production in Germany.

We explored how electricity consumption and production in Germany have varied over time, using pandas time series tools to answer questions such as:

---When is electricity consumption typically highest and lowest?
---How do wind and solar power production vary with seasons of the year?
---What are the long-term trends in electricity consumption, solar power, and wind power?
---How do wind and solar power production compare with electricity consumption, and how has this ratio changed over time?
